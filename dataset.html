  <h1>Quotebank dataset</h1>
  <div style="text-align: justify">
    <p><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3437963.3441760">Quotebank</a> is a corpus of quotations attributed to the speakers who uttered them, extracted from 
      162 million English news articles published between 2015 and 2020. The quotations have been extracted with _Quobert_, a machine learning framework used for 
      extracting an attributing quotations from a corpus of news articles.</p>

  <h1>Clean and filtered Quotebank Climate-related dataset</h1>
  <div style="text-align: justify">
    <p>In this project we used a subset of the Quotebank dataset, a corpus of quotations that we identified as climate-change-related, extracted from the entire 
      Quotebank dataset. It results from the cleaning and filtering of the Quotebank dataset. The filtering to obtain climate-related quotes was done using a list 
      of keywords, that was extracted using logistic regression from two given test sets (see below).</p>

  <h1>Speaker dataset</h1>
  <div style="text-align: justify">
    <p>In addition to the climate-related Quotebank subset we used a list of all the speakers that appear in the Quotebank dataset, containing their characterists,
      such as nationality, gender, education, political party, date of birth, ethinc group and religion. We also enriched this data with a column containing 
      boolean values describing whether this person talks about climate or not. The first value is True if any quote from this speaker is found in the Climate related 
      Dataset. For futherer analyses, we kept the 20 most represented features for each column and turned them into one-hot columns. This enabled us to handle the 
      categorical data.</p>

  <h1>Logistic regression training datasets</h1>
  <div style="text-align: justify">
    <p>Theses two datasets are used to train and test the logistic regression model used to classify our quotes as climate related or not. They were found on the 
      article from <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00483">Varini et al.</a> These datasets are composed of sentences labeled as climate related or not. They 
      were obtained using Active Learning on previously existing datasets.</p>
