    Despite the scientifically esthablished climate emergency, there is still a lack of general action fighting against global warming, and a non-negligeable 
    climatesceptical tendancy in the population. As a large part of the information the population receives is in the press, we would like to understand how is the 
    environmental topic tackled in this media. The aim of the project is to provide deep insigth on who is talking about climate change, and how. Indeed, we would like 
    to first understand what caracteristics make a person more inclined to talk about climate. Then, we would like to assess what proportion of the environmental mediatic 
    representation is actually taken by climat denial. This will enable us to have a global vizualisation of what kind of information is made available to the public,
    and thus a better understanding of why so many people feel not concerned about climate change.

    To do so, we worked on the <a href="https://anissaha.github.io/quotebank/">Quotebank dataset</a>, a dataset referencing all quotations in the newspaper between 
    the years 2015 and 2020. We came up with several questions to answer to guide our analyses of the dataset : 
  </p>
  <ul>
              <li>What is the current typical profile of a person talking about climate in the media ? Is it the same for other topic ?</li>
              <li>Based on the evolution of the profile of a person talking about climate in the media, can we predict what characteristics will a climate-involved 
                          person have in the future ?</li>
              <li>Is there any temporal evolution in the mediatic coverage of the climate crisis ? If so, does it correlate with specific events ?</li>
              <li>Who are the top 10 people that talks the most about climate change over the year ? Does it show an evolution in the general opinions made publicly 
                          avaiblable by mainstream media ?</li>
              <li>Are some communities excluded from the mediatic discussion surround climate change ?</li>
              <li>What is the most represented climate crisis-related topic along the years ? Does it show an evolution in the general opinions made publicly avaiblable 
                          by mainstream media ?</li>
              <li>How do the education and occupation of people represented in the media impact their opinion on the climate crisis ?</li>
            </ul>
