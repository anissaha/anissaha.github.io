              Despite the scientifically established climate emergency, there is still a lack of action against global warming. The aim of this project is to 
              provide deep insight on the mediatic representation of climate-related issues. We have first investigated the temporal evolution of the climate 
              change topic in the media, then understood the main characteristics of people mentioning it, as well as their opinions. Climate change is a very 
              polarizing subject, so we have looked to the general feeling toward this topic. We also tried to predict, based on the climate-involved people profil, 
              whether speaker would be inclined to talk about climate.

  <p>
    To do so, we worked on the <a href="https://anissaha.github.io/quotebank/">Quotebank dataset</a>, a dataset referencing all quotations in the newspaper between 
    the years 2015 and 2020. We came up with several questions to answer to guide our analyses of the dataset : 
  </p>
  <ul>
              <li>What is the current typical profile of a person talking about climate in the media ? Is it the same for other topic ?</li>
              <li>Based on the evolution of the profile of a person talking about climate in the media, can we predict what characteristics will a climate-involved 
                          person have in the future ?</li>
              <li>Is there any temporal evolution in the mediatic coverage of the climate crisis ? If so, does it correlate with specific events ?</li>
              <li>Who are the top 10 people that talks the most about climate change over the year ? Does it show an evolution in the general opinions made publicly 
                          avaiblable by mainstream media ?</li>
              <li>Are some communities excluded from the mediatic discussion surround climate change ?</li>
              <li>What is the most represented climate crisis-related topic along the years ? Does it show an evolution in the general opinions made publicly avaiblable 
                          by mainstream media ?</li>
              <li>How do the education and occupation of people represented in the media impact their opinion on the climate crisis ?</li>
            </ul>
