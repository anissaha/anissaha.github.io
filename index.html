              Despite the scientifically established climate emergency, there is still a lack of action against global warming. The aim of this project is to 
              provide deep insight on the mediatic representation of climate-related issues. We have first investigated the temporal evolution of the climate 
              change topic in the media, then understood the main characteristics of people mentioning it, as well as their opinions. Climate change is a very 
              polarizing subject, so we have looked to the general feeling toward this topic. We also tried to predict, based on the climate-involved people profil, 
              whether speaker would be inclined to talk about climate.

    To do so, we worked on the <a href="https://anissaha.github.io/quotebank/">Quotebank dataset</a>, a dataset referencing all quotations in the newspaper between 
    the years 2015 and 2020. To guide our analyses of the data, we came up with several questions to answer : 
  </p>
  <ul>
              <li>Is there any temporal evolution in the mediatic coverage of the climate crisis ?</li><br>
              <li>What are the main typical profiles of people talking about climate in the media ? Who in the media represent the most this subject over time ?</li><br>
              <li>What is the main sentiment communicated in the media over time concerning the climate crisis ?</li><br>
              <li>Based on the profile of person talking about climate in the media, can we predict what characteristics will a climate-involved person have in the future ?</li><br>
            </ul>
            <p>
