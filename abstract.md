subtitle: A deep dive into the mediatic place of climate change
---

Despite the scientifically esthablished climate emergency, there is still a lack of general action fighting against global warming, and a non-negligeable 
climatesceptical tendancy in the population. As a large part of the information the population receives is in the press, we would like to understand how is the 
environmental topic tackled in this media. The aim of the project is to provide deep insigth on who is talking about climate change, and how. Indeed, we would like 
to first understand what caracteristics make a person more inclined to talkabout climate. Then, we would like to assess what proportion of the environmental mediac 
representation is actually taken by climat denial. This will enable us to have a global vizualisation of what kind of information is made available to the public media, 
and thus a better understanding of why so many people are not concerned about climate change.
