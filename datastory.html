  <h1>The Magic Words of Climate Change</h1>
  <div style="text-align: justify">
    <p>We extracted words usually used in speeches about climate from external sources (cf. <a href="https://anissaha.github.io/quotebank/">Dataset</a>) and ended up 
      with this list of keywords :</p>
    <img src="/assets/img/Capture.PNG" alt="keyword cloud" class="center">
    <p>We then used this list to filter the Quotebank dataset and extract from it the quotations related to climate. We ended up with a dataset containing 292'820 
    quotations.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h1><i>"Climate and environment are a hot topic now"</i> - Greta Thunberg</h1>
  <div style="text-align: justify">
    <p>In order to visualize the temporal evolution of the space allocated to climate change in th emedia, we plotted the number of quotes related to 
      climate in each year :</p>
    <img src="/assets/img/temporal_year.PNG" alt="temporal evolution of the amount of quotes related to climate accross years" class="center">
    <p>Unsurprisingly, we can see that from 2015 to 2019 the number of quotes that talk about climate have been rising, except for the year 2016 and 2020. 
      This rise is explained by the fact that we are more and more aware about climate change due in particluar to the huge mobiblization of the younger generation. 
      Indeed, at only 15 years old Greta Thunberg became the leader of an ecologist movement during the summer 2018 and her reputation has not stopped growing since.
    </p>
    <p>Concerning the gap in the years 2020, the quotebank dataset has not extracted quotes since April 2020, that is why this year has less quotes. For the year 2016, 
      the gap could be explained by the fact that the dataset is incomplete, or that there were actually less discussion about climate. The 8th November 2016 Donald Trump was 
      elected President of the United States and the election was a major mediatic event, probably letting less space for climate-change discussions. But still, the difference 
      is huge (~30'000) and that is unlikely that this is the only explanation.
    </p>
  </div>
  
    <h2>Climate-related events are spotable in the quotes distribution</h2>
  <div>
    <p>In order to better understand this phenomena we can look at a monthly visualization of the temporal evolution of climate change speech in the newspaper :</p>
    <img src="/assets/img/temporal_month.PNG" alt="temporal evolution of the amount of quotes related to climate accross months" class="center">
    <p>During the year 2016 there is a huge disparity in the number of quotes across the months. We can assume that the gap is more likely explained by a lack of data.
      The lack of data could be in the original dataset. This hypothesis could be confirmed by plotting the distribution of the quotations from Quotebank over the last 
      6 years.
    </p>
    <p>This plot also displays other interesting results. First of all, we can see an increase of the number of climate-related quotes in 2015. Especially, we can see 
      a spike in December, corresponding to the <a href="https://unfccc.int/fr/processus-et-reunions/l-accord-de-paris/l-accord-de-paris">The Paris Agreement</a>. 
      We investigated the events that took place during the other big spikes we can see on the plot : </p>
    <p style="background-color:tomato;">May 2017 and September 2019. Indeed,</p>

  <h1>Politicians are (too) chatty</h1>
  <div style="text-align: justify">
    <p>To characterize the typical person who would most likely talk about climate in the media, we have first selected only the speakers of the quotations related to climate 
      (cf. <a href="https://anissaha.github.io/quotebank/">Dataset</a>) and selected the 20 most frequent label for each characteristic (occupation, religion, ethnic 
      group, academic degree, gender, political party and nationality). The plots below corresponds to the number of speaker per label (here are only showed the plots 
      for occupation and political party but the rest can be found on <a href="https://notebooks.githubusercontent.com/view/ipynb?browser=firefox&color_mode=auto&commit=7f052b171e894097b7350f341fd70c59164e7879&device=unknown_device&enc_url=68747470733a2f2f7261772e67697468756275736572636f6e74656e742e636f6d2f6570666c2d6164612f6164612d323032312d70726f6a6563742d61766164612d6b6564617672612f376630353262313731653839343039376237333530663334316664373063353931363465373837392f66696e616c2e6970796e62&logged_in=true&nwo=epfl-ada%2Fada-2021-project-avada-kedavra&path=final.ipynb&platform=windows&repository_id=421744360&repository_type=Repository&version=95">our notebook</a> :</p>
    <img src="/assets/img/speakers_climate_occupation_party.png" alt="speakers occupation and political party" class="center">
    <p>We can see that the first 5 occupation are in order, politician, actor, writer, journalist and football player. The fact that the politicians are the first one 
      is quite obvious since it is nowadays a very politicized topic. The actor and football player are a bit more surprising but we can imagine that this is because 
      these are more mediatized occupation and their quotations can already be found in higher number in the press. In order to confirm this hypothesis, we have plotted 
      the occupation proportion of the speakers from Quotebank :</p>
    <img src="/assets/img/speakers_mixte.png" alt="speakers occupation and political party distribution in Quotebank" class="center">
    <p>We can observe that the top 5 occupations are similar which means that thy are the type of people that are the most present in the press meaning that it was  
      expected to find them in the top 5 of the climate speakers.
    </p>
    <p>One thing we can notice on these graphs is the apparition of a polical party focused majoritarily on environmental concern in the climate-related distribution: 
      The Greens. A critical thing to amphesize is that there are very little number of scientists, researchers or activits in the mediated climate-involved speakers. 
      Rather than showing that they are not vocal about this issue, it rathers points out that the mediatic place seems to be monopolized by politics and celebrities 
      (actors). This should be nuanced as we are looking at the speakers without considering how much they actually talk about climate in the media. We will now focus 
      on the people that talk the most about climate.</p>
    <h2>Top Speakers</p>
    <p>From the climate-related speakers we extracted 10 people with the highest number of occurrences over the year. Below are histograms representing the number
    of times the speaker has been quoted for something related to climate in the news :</p>
    <img src="/assets/img/top_10.jpeg" alt="top 10 speakers occurences distribution" class="center">
    <p>Between 2015 and 2018, we can see that the first speaker per year is the American President. This shows that the main opinion mediatized is a political one, 
      meaning that it may not be very objective, and highly dependent on the President's party. After 2018, we see the fulgurant apparison of Greta Thunberg, a very 
      famous climate activist. This shows a shift in the mediatic reprsentation, from a political topic to a human issue. The rest of the speakers are mostly 
      politicians, but we also see a progressive apparison of less known environmentalists and activists, such as John Sauven. These observations seem to indicate 
      that a large majority of climate-related information given to the public is not objective. This could mean, for the public, that most climate-related input are 
      actually political opinions, and not scientific facts.</p>
    <h2>Top 3</h2>
    <p>Now, let us study the shift from politics to activism in the mediatization of the climate change topic. In order to do that, we studied the mediatic place of 
      the top 3 observed speakers, meaning Donald Trump, Greta Thunberg and Barack Obama.</p>
    <img src="/assets/img/top_3.PNG" alt="top 3 speakers occurences distribution" class="center">
    <p>Once again, we see that we have a smaller number of quotes from 2020, (see <i>"Climate and environment are a hot topic now"</i> - Greta Thunberg section). 
      Then, we see that from 2015 to 2017, there is only Barack Obama and Donald Trump. Then ,starting in 2018, we see the apparison of Greta Thunberg. She then 
      managed to have a very high mediatic place very quickly. This shows us that the climate change is starting to be considered more as human concern, rather than 
      a political subject.</p>
    <h2>Top Quotes</h2>
    <p>We will now see if this shift can also be seen in the quotes themselves, by studying the top quotes of the top 10 speakers per year. We extracted quotes with 
      the maximum number of occurrences from each of the top 10 speakers of each year and visualized it. This allows us to observe which ideas are most mediatizeded.
    The top 10 quotes can be found on <a href="https://notebooks.githubusercontent.com/view/ipynb?browser=firefox&color_mode=auto&commit=7f052b171e894097b7350f341fd70c59164e7879&device=unknown_device&enc_url=68747470733a2f2f7261772e67697468756275736572636f6e74656e742e636f6d2f6570666c2d6164612f6164612d323032312d70726f6a6563742d61766164612d6b6564617672612f376630353262313731653839343039376237333530663334316664373063353931363465373837392f66696e616c2e6970796e62&logged_in=true&nwo=epfl-ada%2Fada-2021-project-avada-kedavra&path=final.ipynb&platform=windows&repository_id=421744360&repository_type=Repository&version=95#Top-Quotes">our Notebook</a>.</p>
    <p>When having a look at our top climate related quotes, we see a lot of people talking about the urgency of the climate change situation, but without stating 
      the detailled scientific facts. This shows that, indeed the urgency is communicated, but the analysis showing that we are in a critical situation is not very 
      mediatized. During the Trump Presidency, we see te rise of climate denier speakers such as Scott Pruitt. On the climate denier sides, we see that they seems to 
      discredit major climate cange related agreements,such as the Paris Agreements. One thing we can emphasize, is the apparison of a quote in accordance with the 
      last GIEC report:" Even the solutions that we have considered big and bold are nowhere near the scale of the actual problem that climate change presents to us" 
      (AOC). It seems like the sentiment of urgency communicated grows over the years.</p>

  <h1>The general feeling about climate change is (surprisingly) positive</h1>
  <div style="text-align: justify">
    <p>Climate change is a very polarizing subject and we wanted to investigate the general feeling toward it in the media. To do this we performed the Vader 
      Sentiment Analysis (cf. <a href="https://anissaha.github.io/methods/">Methods</a>) on the climate-related quotations. This gave us the following results : </p>
    <img src="/assets/img/sentiment.png" alt="sentiment analyses" class="center">
    <p> The plots above are showing the proportion of positive and negative quotes among all the climate-related quotes for each year. We can observe that the general 
      feeling is overall more positive than negative. We also see more extreme value for the negative feeling in 2020 than in 2015. This could be due to the climate 
      emergency that is taking more and more space in people's mind and, consequently, in the media. On the contrary, the positive rate has more extreme values in 2015 
      than in 2020. We have also extracted the quotes with the highest rate for each year and they can again be foun on 
      <a href="https://notebooks.githubusercontent.com/view/ipynb?browser=firefox&color_mode=auto&commit=7f052b171e894097b7350f341fd70c59164e7879&device=unknown_device&enc_url=68747470733a2f2f7261772e67697468756275736572636f6e74656e742e636f6d2f6570666c2d6164612f6164612d323032312d70726f6a6563742d61766164612d6b6564617672612f376630353262313731653839343039376237333530663334316664373063353931363465373837392f66696e616c2e6970796e62&logged_in=true&nwo=epfl-ada%2Fada-2021-project-avada-kedavra&path=final.ipynb&platform=windows&repository_id=421744360&repository_type=Repository&version=95#Positive-and-negative-rates-of-the-quotes-over-time">our Notebook</a>.</p>
    <p>In order to check if this sentiment analysis makes sense we extracted the words with the highest frequency in the quotations with the highest positive or 
      negative rate. The words clouds generated with them are below, red for negative and blue for positive :

  <p style="background-color:tomato;">conclusion about this</p>
       
  <h2>Democrates are more emotional about climate</h2>
  <div style="text-align: justify">
    <p>While looking at the main profiles that talk about climate in the section above, we realised that the two major political parties in the US are the two most 
      represented in the climate-related mediatic speech. As they are opponents of each other and knowing the propensity of the Republicans to doubt about the climate
      crisis, we would expect the democratic party to be more aware and concerned by climate change than republicans 
      (<a href="https://www.thechicagocouncil.org/research/public-opinion-survey/2021-chicago-council-survey">2021 Chicago Council Survey</a>). We have then looked 
      at the general feeling in the quotes from Republicans versus Democrates : </p>
    <img src="/assets/img/politic_sentiment.PNG" alt="sentiment analyses for political parties" class="center">
    <p style="background-color:tomato;">description of the plot</p>
    <p>We observe that in both negative and positive case that the democratic party people have slightly higher rates. But the median are very close to each other 
      and the boxplots are overlapping. To determine if the means are significantly different, we performed two t-tests on, respectively, positive and negative rates : </p>
    <p style="font-size:15px"><samp>Ttest_indResult(statistic=-5.872865752320066, pvalue=4.308443966327444e-09)<br>
      Ttest_indResult(statistic=-18.86696547764224, pvalue=3.852534994433051e-79)</samp></p>
    <p>According to pvalues that are both very small, we can conclude that the two means are significantly different and thus there is a difference between the two 
      populations.Consequently, we can observe the democratic party people have higher rates and this could be explained by a higher investement than the republicans.</p>

  <h1>Tell me who you are and I will tell you if you feel concerned about climate change</h1>
  <div style="text-align: justify">
    <p>As we observed that some characterstics seemed to be based on the features extracted from the dataframe speakers, we tried to create a prediction model based on 
      logistic regression.</p>
      <p style="font-size:15px">Methods : First, we separated the dataset in a train and a test subset. We then visualized the baseline model in order to determine which 
      modfications we could apply on our train set. Finally, we did some hypertunning to determine the best prediction model.</p>
    <p>
      We tried to predict whether a person would be inclined to talk about climate in the press based on their profile. Taking the 20 most frequent labels
      in each characteristic as predictors, we infered with a logistic regression a binary value, either climate or not, on each speaker and compared it to the reality, 
      i.e. whether they were present in the climate related speakers dataset. The final model is the following :
