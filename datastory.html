  <h1>Magic Words for Climate Change</h1>
  <div style="text-align: justify">
    <p>We extracted words usually used in speeches about climate from external sources (cf. <a href="https://anissaha.github.io/quotebank/">Dataset</a>) and ended up 
      with this list of keywords :</p>
    <img src="/assets/img/Capture.PNG" alt="keyword cloud" class="center">
    <p>We then used this list to filter the Quotebank dataset and extract from it the quotations related to climate.</p>
  </div>
  
  <h1>We talk more and more about climate</h1>
  <div style="text-align: justify">
    <p>The plot below shows the number of quotes related to climate for each year :</p>
    <img src="/assets/img/temporal_year.PNG" alt="temporal evolution of the amount of quotes related to climate accross years" class="center">
    <p>Unsurprisingly, we can see that from 2015 to 2019 the number of quotes that talk about climate have been rising, except for the year 2016 and 2020. 
      This rise is explained by the fact that we are more and more aware about climate change due in particluar to the huge mobiblization of the younger generation. 
      Indeed, at only 15 years old Greta Thunberg became the leader of an ecologist movement during the summer 2018 and her reputation has not stopped growing since.
    </p>
    <p>Concerning the gap in the years 2020, the quotebank dataset has not extracted quotes since April 2020, that is why this year has less quotes. For the year 2016, 
      the gap could be explained by the fact that the dataset is incomplete, or that there was actually less talks about climate. The 8th November 2016 Donald Trump was 
      elected President of the United States and the election was a major mediatic event. That could have let less space in the press for talking about climate and this 
      could explain this gap. But still, the difference is huge (chiffre!) and that is unlikely that this is the only explanation.
    </p>
    <p>In order to better understand this phenomena we can look at a monthly visualization of the temporal evolution of climate change speech in the newspaper :</p>
    <img src="/assets/img/temporal_month.PNG" alt="temporal evolution of the amount of quotes related to climate accross months" class="center">
    <p>During the year 2016 there is a huge disparity in the number of quotes across the months. We can assume that the gap is more likely explained by a lack of data.
      The lack of data could be in the original dataset. This hypothesis could be confirmed by plotting the distribution of the quotations from Quotebank over the last 
      6 years.

  <h1>Speakers occupation</h1>
  <div style="text-align: justify">
    <p>To characterize the typical person who would most likely talk about climate in the media, we have first selected only the speakers of the quotations related to climate 
      (cf. <a href="https://anissaha.github.io/quotebank/">Dataset</a>) and selected the 20 most frequent label for each characteristic (occupation, religion, ethnic 
      group, academic degree, gender, political party and nationality). The plots below corresponds to the number of speaker per label (here are only showed the plots 
      for occupation and political party but the rest can be found on <a href="https://github.com/epfl-ada/ada-2021-project-avada-kedavra/blob/main/final.ipynb">our notebook</a> :</p>
    <img src="/assets/img/speakers_climate_occupation_party.png" alt="speakers occupation and political party" class="center">
    <p>We can see that the first 5 occupation are in order, politician, actor, writer, journalist and football player. The fact that the politicians are the first one 
      is quite obvious since it is nowadays a very politicized topic. The actor and football player are a bit more surprising but we can imagine that this is because 
      these are more mediatized occupation and their quotations can already be found in higher number in the press. In order to confirm this hypothesis, we have plotted 
      the occupation proportion of the speakers from Quotebank :</p>

  <h1>General feeling about climate change is (surprisingly) positive</h1>
  <div style="text-align: justify">
    <p>Climate change is a very polarizing subject and we wanted to investigate the general feeling toward it in the media. To do this we performed the Vader 
      sentiment analysis (cf. <a href="https://anissaha.github.io/methods/">Methods</a>) on the climate-related quotations. This gave us the following results : </p>
    <img src="/assets/img/sentiment.png" alt="sentiment analyses" class="center">
    <p> The plots above are showing the proportion of positive and negative quotes among all the climate-related quotes for each year. We can observe that the general 
      feeling is overall more positive then negative. We also see more extreme value for the negative feeling in 2020 than in 2015. This could be due to the climate 
      emergency that is taking more and more space in people's mind and, consequently, in the media. On the contrary, the positive rate has more extreme values in 2015 
      than in 2020.</p>
    <p>In order to check if this sentiment analysis makes sense we extracted the words with the highest frequency in the quotations with the highest positive or 
      negative rate. The words clouds generated with them are below, red for negative and blue for positive :

  <h2>Democrates talk about climate with more emotions than Republicans</h2>
  <div style="text-align: justify">
    <p>While looking at the main profiles that talk about climate in the section above, we realised that the two major political parties in the US are the two most 
      represented in the climate-related mediatic speech. As they are opponents of each other and knowing the propensity of the Republicans to doubt about the climate
      crisis, we would expect the democratic party to be more aware and concerned by climate change than republicans 
      (<a href="https://www.thechicagocouncil.org/research/public-opinion-survey/2021-chicago-council-survey">2021 Chicago Council Survey</a>). We have then looked 
      at the general feeling in the quotes from Republicans versus Democrates : </p>
    <img src="/assets/img/politic_sentiment.PNG" alt="sentiment analyses for political parties" class="center">
    <p>We observe that in both negative and positive case that the democratic party people have higher rates and this could be explained by a higher investement 
      than the republicans.</p>
