_“Quotations will tell the full measure of meaning, if you have enough of them.” —James Murray_

The dataset [Quotebank](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3437963.3441760) is a corpus of quotations attributed to the speakers who uttered them, extracted from 162 million English news articles published between 2015 and 2020. The quotations have been extracted with _Quobert_, a machine learning framework used for extracting an attributing quotations from a corpus of news articles.

In this project we used a subset of the Quotebank dataset, a corpus of quotations that we identified as climate-change-related, extracted from the entire Quotebank dataset. It results from the cleaning and filtering of the Quotebank dataset. The filtering to obtain climate-related quotes was done using a list of keywords, that was extracted using logistic regression and the two given test sets.
